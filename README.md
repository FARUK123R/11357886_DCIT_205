the website was about re creating the computer science department and editing it
i have learnt to use the html attributes very well
i have also learnt to use the sematic markup
Semantic Markup: I've learned the importance of using semantic HTML tags (<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.) to convey the meaning and structure of content, making pages more accessible and readable
HtMl forms also became easy for me to use
the linking and navigation also became easy
Linking and Navigation: Creating hyperlinks (<a>) and understanding navigation concepts within web pages and between different pages/sites using URLs
Structural Understanding: HTML taught me about the essential structure of web pages using elements like <html>, <head>, <body>, and more. These elements provide the framework for content on a webpage.
Multimedia Integration: HTML tags for embedding multimedia elements such as images, videos (<img>, <video>, <audio>), and interactive components enrich the user experience.

in css
i have learnt:Styling and Layout: CSS allows for precise control over the visual presentation of HTML elements. I've learned about various properties (color, font-size, margin, padding, display, position, etc.) and their impact on styling and layout.
Selectors and Specificity: Understanding CSS selectors (element, class, id, attribute, pseudo-classes, etc.) and specificity helps in targeting and styling specific elements effectively.
